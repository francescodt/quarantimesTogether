I have a background in cooking (15 years), bartending, serving, and restaurant management. Since coming to Iowa in 2012 I have finished my bachelor's degree in business management. I have had an extensive musical career in Nashville, TN and although music is one of the main focuses of my life I am currently switching gears to study coding at deltaV and I aim to have an entry level position lined up by the end of summer.</h3>

After years of working many different jobs, many temp jobs, i decided I really needed a career. I stumbled into DeltaV and have been loving it ever since. I enjoy using my desire to create new things, and utilize my problem solving and troubleshooting skills.  I can't wait to learn more about server-side programming in 401, and start my new career.</h3>

    <img class="img4" src="/authors/Francesco.png" width= 120px height= 100px/><h3 class="profile4">My name is Francesco Troiano. I am a current student of the DeltaV code 201 course, and come from Waterloo, IA. I had worked in many customer service jobs prior to coming to Cedar Rapids to begin my coding career. I had moved into this field at the advice of a good friend and with knowledge of an ever growing market. I had heard some things about becoming a full stack developer and figured my ability to bring people together would fit perfectly into a world of people coming from all different backgrounds. I come from many jobs that have celebrated diversity and awareness, and helped lead some of those fronts and am excited to continue that development into the wonderful world of coding.</h3>
